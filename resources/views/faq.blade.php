                    <ul>
                        <li>You can book the tickets online which is a very simple three step process. We advise you to book your tickets at least two hours before scheduled departure. After you purchase your ticket you will receive an email confirmation that also serves as your boarding pass for most of the bus partners.</li>

                    <b>Do I have to pay extra when compared to buying the tickets offline?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NUB BUS does not charge anything extra when compared to the traditional way (offline). The tickets are absolutely at the same cost that the travel bus partner has priced them.</li>
