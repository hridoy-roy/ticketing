                                Cardholder privacy is important to NUB BUS To better protect the privacy of cardholder data, NUB BUS provides this privacy statement explaining the security and
                                handling practices of cardholder data in the processing of payment card transactions.<br />

                                This privacy statement applies to all cardholder data collected by or submitted to NUB BUS’s website. Our website will only collect personally identifiable information and cardholder data
                                voluntarily provided by cardholders and customers, and will only use that information for the specific purposes for which it was provided. NUB BUS will keep this information strictly
                                confidential, and will not disclose, sell, or lease the information to third parties unless required by law, or with the written permission of the cardholder.<br />
                                <br />
                                As with most websites used for payment card transaction services, our web servers collect web session data used to analyze site trends and gather broad demographic data. NUB BUS reserves
                                the right to collect certain technical information of customers such as operating system, IP address, web browser software, and URL data through the use of cookies or other technology not linked to personally
                                identifiable information or cardholder data.<br />

                                NUB BUS-maintained websites may have links to other third-party sites used for payment card transactions. These third-party sites may collect cardholder data and personally identifiable
                                information through the use of forms or cookies, or from the customer's web browser. Cardholders and customers are strongly encouraged to review the privacy policies of all third-party websites outside the
                                control of NUB BUS for their procedures for collecting, utilizing, and disclosing cardholder data.<br />
                                <br />
                                We have made significant investment in security measures employed to protect cardholder data under our control. Access to acquired cardholder data and personally identifiable information is limited to only
                                those personnel for whom there is an established business need to access that data.<br />
                                <br />
                                For questions, comments, or concerns regarding this privacy statement, or NUB BUS’s procedures for securely processing, storing, or transmitting cardholder data, please contact us via
